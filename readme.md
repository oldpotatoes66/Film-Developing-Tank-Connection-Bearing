I designed and made a connection bearing for rolling wash of a developing tank. This connection bearing connects the developing tank and the motor, making it convenient to wash the film. The connection between the developing tank and the bearing is achieved using two magnets with a diameter of 30mm.

我设计制作显影罐滚动冲洗连接轴承
通过这个连接轴承连接显影罐以及电机，这样可以方便对胶卷进行冲洗。
显影罐和轴承之间通过2片直径30mm的磁铁进行连接。
